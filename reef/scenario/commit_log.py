"""Per-scenario commit log: the single durable commit point for training steps.

Every step-advancing commit appends exactly one record here, and every other
store is derived from it: record-store compaction is replayed from the
records' high-water marks, the checkpoint head is restored from the last
record's ref, and the trainer's algorithm state and read progress resume from
the same record. The log is append-only JSONL; the append (+fsync) is the
commit point, ordered so a crash anywhere else is recoverable by replay:

- live step:       commit trainer -> append record -> compact -> advance head
- checkpoint step: commit trainer -> publish version -> append record -> compact
- local step:      commit trainer -> stage -> advance head -> append record -> compact
- no-artifact:     commit trainer -> append record -> compact
- rollback:        restore surface -> commit trainer -> publish copy -> append record -> compact

A checkpoint publish therefore never loses its record (the repository write comes
first), and a crash between append and compaction is healed at recovery by
re-applying the recorded deletions. A local step may advance the head before
appending because a staged ref is process-local and never a recovery source:
a crash before the append loses the head move and the record together, so the
step simply never committed. If the checkpoint head is ahead of the log
(crash between publish and append), recovery adopts the checkpoint head — its
snapshot metadata carries the same record fields — and appends it to heal the
log. Rollback follows the checkpoint order and appends a record whose
operation points at the restored step while the fencing step keeps increasing.
